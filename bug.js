This bug occurs when using the Expo managed workflow with a project that uses a significant number of native modules.  The app may crash during the build process or fail to start after installation. This is often due to conflicts between native dependencies or incorrect linking of the native modules.

Example Code (Illustrative, not the exact cause but shows native module usage):
```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

const useNativeModule = () => {
  MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction();
};
```
