Debugging this issue requires a systematic approach:

1. **Dependency Analysis:** Use `react-native-info` or similar tools to identify the native modules included in the project. Examine versions to check for incompatibility between packages.
2. **Cleaning the Project:**  Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies. `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`.
3. **Review the `package.json`:** Check dependencies carefully for conflicts.  Ensure that all versions align as intended.
4. **Gradual Integration:** If adding new native modules, add them one at a time to more easily pinpoint problematic interactions. Test the application after each addition.
5. **Rebuild from Scratch:** In some cases, starting a fresh Expo project and gradually moving over the codebase can assist in identifying a root problem.
6. **Expo Docs and Forums:** Consult the official Expo documentation and community forums for similar reported issues and potential solutions.

Example of Improved `package.json` (Illustrative):
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.71.8",
    "expo-constants": ">=0.2.0 <0.3.0",
    "react-native-camera": "4.3.2"
  }
}
```
Note: Specific version numbers may vary based on your project's requirements and available native modules.
